## Key Components
Here are some of the key components in the Components folder:

- `ChatInput.razor`:  This component handles the input area for the chat. It includes a text area for the user to type their message and a send button to send the message.
- `AttachmentManager.razor`: This component is responsible for uploading attachments. It includes the file input, and list of uploaded files.
- `ModelMarkdown.razor`: This component is used to display the response from the inference in markdown format. It takes a ModelResponse object as a parameter and listens for changes in the response. When the response changes, it updates the markdown content to be rendered.
- `Settings.razor`: This component handles user configurable settings (Theme, Inference, System Message).

## Key Pages
Here's a key page in the Pages folder:

- `Index.razor`: This is the main chat component of the application. It uses the ChatService.cs to implement its functionality.
- `MainLayout.razor`: This is the main layout of the application. It includes a header with the application title and a body where the current page is rendered. The layout is defined using the FluentContainer and FluentRow components from the Fluent UI library, providing a consistent look and feel across the application.

## Key Services
- `ChatService.cs`: The main service provided by Dependency Injection for operating the UI.
- `WebSocketChatService.cs`: The service used by the ChatService to interact with the server via WebSockets.
