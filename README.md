## Features

PalmHill.BlazorChat offers a range of features to provide a seamless and interactive chat experience:

- **Real-Time Chat**: Engage in real-time conversations with the help of SignalR, which ensures instant message delivery.

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation for Uploaded Docs**: This feature allows users to chat about content within uploaded documents. By leveraging retrieval augmented generation, the chatbot can reference and incorporate specific information from these documents in its responses, providing a more personalized and context-aware interaction. Early version.

- **Markdown Support**: The [`ModelMarkdown.razor`](PalmHill.BlazorChat/Client/Components/ModelMarkdown.razor#L1-L53) component allows for markdown formatting in chat messages, enhancing readability and user experience.

- **Chat Settings**: Customize your chat experience with adjustable settings such as temperature, max length, top P, frequency penalty, and presence penalty, all managed by the [`ChatSettings.razor`](PalmHill.BlazorChat/Client/Components/ChatSettings.razor#L1-L37) component.

- **Error Handling**: The application gracefully handles errors and displays a user-friendly error page [`Error.razor`](PalmHill.BlazorChat/Client/Pages/Error.razor#L1-L15) when an unhandled error occurs.

- **Responsive Layout**: The application layout is responsive and provides a consistent look and feel across different screen sizes, thanks to the `FluentContainer` and `FluentRow` components from the Fluent UI library.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into three main directories:

- [Client](PalmHill.BlazorChat/Client/README.md): Contains the Blazor WebAssembly user interface.

- [Server](PalmHill.BlazorChat/Server/README.md): Contains the server-side websocket/SignalR and REST/WebAPI logic for the application. You can set the model file location in this project in appsettings.json. 

- [Llama](PalmHill.Llama/README.md): This is a wrapper for [LlamaSharp](https://github.com/SciSharp/LLamaSharp). Contains the code related to the Llama models.

 
## Getting Started

To get started with PalmHill.BlazorChat, follow these simple steps to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing:

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **.NET 8**: This application requires the .NET 8 framework. You can download it from [the official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).
- **CUDA 12**: Currently CUDA 12 is required. Download and install CUDA 12 from [NVIDIA's CUDA Toolkit page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12.0-download-archive).


### Step 1: Download and Place the Language Model
1. **Download the Language Model:** First, you'll need to download the appropriate Llama 2 language model for the application. Any GGUF/Llama2 model should work and can be downloaded from Huggingface. We recommend selecting a model that will fit your VRAM and RAM from [this list](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Orca-2-13B-GGUF).

    For testing [TheBloke/CapybaraHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/CapybaraHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GGUF/blob/main/capybarahermes-2.5-mistral-7b.Q8_0.gguf) was used and requires at least 10gb VRAM.
    

2. **Place the Model:** Once downloaded, place the model file in a designated directory on your system. Remember the path of this directory, as you'll need it for configuring the application.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
1. **Clone the Repository:** Use Git to clone the PalmHill.BlazorChat repository to your local machine. Alternatively, you can open the project directly from GitHub using Visual Studio. 
   - To clone, use the command: `git clone [https://github.com/edgett/PalmHill.BlazorChat.git]`.
   - If using Visual Studio, select 'Clone a repository' and enter the repository URL.

### Step 3: Configure the Startup Project
1. **Open the Solution in Visual Studio:** Once the repository is cloned, open the solution file in Visual Studio.
2. **Set the Startup Project:** In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the `Server` project and select 'Set as StartUp Project'. This ensures that the server-side logic is the entry point of the application.

### Step 4: Set the Model Path
1. **Locate `appsettings.json`**: In the root of `Server` project.
2. **Set the Model Path:** Edit `appsettings.json` to include the path to the language model file you placed in step 1. Use double backslashes (`\\`) for the file path to escape the backslashes properly in JSON syntax.

    Example:
    ```json
    "ModelPath": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\model\\model-file-name"
    ```

    Full example:
    ```json
    {
      "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
          "Default": "Information",
          "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
        }
      },
      "AllowedHosts": "*",
      "InferenceModelConfig": {
        "ModelPath": "C:\\models\\capybarahermes-2.5-mistral-7b.Q8_0.gguf",
        "GpuLayerCount": 40,
        "ContextSize": 4096,
        "Gpu": 0,
        "AntiPrompts": [ "User:" ]
      }
    }
    ```


### Step 5: Run the Application
1. **Build the Solution:** Build the solution in Visual Studio to ensure all dependencies are correctly resolved.
2. **Run the Application:** Click 'Play' in Visual Studio to start the application. This will launch the application in your default web browser.
3. **Application URLs:** The application will open to the URLs specified in BlazorChat/Server/`launchSettings.json`, typically `https://localhost:7233` and `http://localhost:5222`. You can access the application via either of these URLs in your browser.

### Troubleshooting and Tips
- Ensure that all necessary NuGet packages are installed and up to date.
- Check the .NET and Blazor WebAssembly versions required for the project.
- If you encounter issues, refer to the 'FAQs' section or reach out to the community for support.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run PalmHill.BlazorChat on your local machine for development and testing. Happy coding!
